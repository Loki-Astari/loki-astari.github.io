  <div class="entry-content"><h3>1: using namspace</h3>

<p>Every new developer that comes to C++ always starts writing code like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>myfirstprog.cpp</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='cpp'><span class='line'><span class="cp">#include &lt;iostream&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">using</span> <span class="k">namespace</span> <span class="n">std</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>It seems reasonable and every book on learning C++ out there perpetrates the same mistake. The problem is the &ldquo; <strong>using namespace std;</strong> &rdquo;. On programs that are only 10 lines long (like in most books) it does not cause any problems. But as soon as your code strays to any meaningful size then it starts to become an issue. The problem with teaching new developers this technique is that they are not aware of the problems it causes and so it becomes a habit for all code they write. Break this habit <strong>now</strong> before you start doing it without thinking at the top of every source file you write.</p>

<p>So what are the actual issues? Please read this article: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/1452721/14065">Why is “using namespace std;” considered bad practice?</a> and the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/1453605/14065">best Answer</a> that explains what the problem is in detail.</p>

<p>We call this problem namespace pollution. What the <code>using</code> clause is doing is pulling everything from the named namespace into the current namespace; this will cause issues if there is already code in the current namespace. Doing this in your source file is bad enough but even worse is doing this in your header file. The problem with doing it in a header file is that you pollute the namespace for every source file that includes your header file. If the user of the header file is not aware of this pollution then trying to track down a suddenly new issue becomes really very hard.</p>

<p>But not doing this is causing my much more typing!</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>toomuch.cpp</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If you think adding <code>std::</code> as a prefix to anything in the standard namespace is a bother (then you need another language); there is a solution. Only pull into the current namespace what you actually need. And then try and restrict the scope so it is tight as possible;</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>short.cpp</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">using</span> <span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">cout</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="c1">// The using clause is scoped and thus cout is only in the global namespace for</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="c1">// the scope of the main() function.</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">cout</span> <span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="s">&quot;Hello Workld</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s">&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>An additional technique to shorten namespace prefixes are namespace alias. These are very useful when things are nested inside multiple namespaces (or have very long unhelpful names)</p>

<h3>2: Prefixing identifiers with &#39;&#95;&#39;</h3>

<p>A lot of developers new to C++ try to learn by browsing the standard libraries and getting there habits from things done there or bring conventions from their current favorite languages into there C++ code. One of the things they ultimately pick up on is using &lsquo;_&rsquo; as a prefix for identifiers.</p>

<p>Though technically not wrong in all situations the actual rules on using the &lsquo;<em>&rsquo; as an identifier prefix are non trivial. Thus making it a habit will eventually get you burnt. The issue is that most identifiers that have prefix &lsquo;</em>&rsquo; are reserved for use by the implementation, thus the compiler/linker may potentially do special things with them. You can read up on the issue here: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/228783/14065">What are the rules about using an underscore in a C++ identifier?</a>.</p>

<h3>3: void main()</h3>

<p>There are only two valid declarations from main in C++</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Setting up WordPress to display syntax highlighted code was a struggle due to different plugins that don’t all seem to work together, the different types of editor, etc. I don’t want to learn all about WordPress. I just want to write some simple articles.</p>

<p>I am at the point where I am productive and don’t destroy my articles accidentally by switching between Visual editor and Text editor, however, I am still not totally happy. Writing articles in pure HTML is not the best solution. Even with help buttons, this is the realm of the web developer that needs to lay out elements perfectly. The article writer (blogger) just needs text to flow and highlight with a smattering of subtle color. I would prefer some slightly higher level markup such as in <code>Stackoverflow</code> or <code>github</code> preferably. If you have worked through this problem and have a good solution, drop me a line.</p>

<p>Here is a list of things I did to make myself productive:</p>

<ul>
<li>Turn off the Visual Editor <br/>
  Switching between the <code>visual</code> editor and the <code>text</code> editor always seems to destroy something in the code. What survived and what was mutated depended on the plugins but the result was always disastrous. Therefore turn it off. <br/>
  Of course this means I am now writing in HTML (not perfect buy I can manage). <br/>
  Goto <code>Users-&gt;Your Profile</code>. The first option allows you to disable the visual editor</li>
<li>Install the plugins:

<ul>
<li>Crayon Syntax Highlighter:  <br/>
There are a lot of syntax highlighters out there. It does not matter which one you choose as they all seem to use the same back-end to do the coloring. This one worked for me.</li>
<li>Preserve Code Formatting: <br/>
This prevents WordPress from mucking with the spaces between the &lt;pre&gt; tags.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>I also asked on <a href="http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/123040/standard-developer-markup-plugins">WordPress.stackexchange.com : Standard developer markup plugins</a> but did not get much help.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is the first article in the series
OK. Lets do this.</p>

<p>I keep trying to think about something big and interesting to write about. But that is just not working. All my time is spent trying to think of the blockbuster idea; which just gets in the way of actually writing. So lets start with the small things. If I can get into the habit of writing something a couple of times a week. Then maybe we can work up to interesting stuff.</p>

<p>Step one; write about something I know. C++; we now start the &ldquo;So you want to learn C++&rdquo; series of posts.</p>

<p>I am going to assume two things.</p>

<ul>
<li>You know how to use the compiler</li>
<li>That you have some basic programming experience C/Java/C#/Perl/Php (nealy anything) <br/>
So you understand the basics of program but are unfamiliar with C++</li>
</ul>


<p>First thing everybody needs is to get something working; here is the classic &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; in C++</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>helloworld.cpp</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='c++'><span class='line'><span class="cp">#include &lt;iostream&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">main</span><span class="p">()</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">{</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The next step is to accepts user input and generates a response based on that input. Lets move on to the not quite as classic &ldquo;Hi There Bob&rdquo; :&ndash;)</p>

<p>The above code is relatively simple and only a few things to note:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;</code> <br/>
Imports the standard input and output facilities so you can print messages to the user and read user input.

<ul>
<li><code>std::cin</code>  <br/>
Is the standard input stream. From this you can read user input.</li>
<li><code>std::cout</code>  <br/>
Is the standard output stream. You can print text to the user console.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>#include &lt;string&gt;</code> <br/>
Imports the standard string handling function. Most importantly it imports the type <code>std::string</code>.

<ul>
<li><code>std::string</code> <br/>
This is one of the standard types and holds strings (a list of characters). We will go over types (and variables) in a lot more details in subsequent articles. But for just accept that <code>line</code> is a variable (of type std::string) used to hold a line of user input.</li>
<li><code>std::getline()</code> <br/>
This is a function that reads a line of text from a <code>std::istream</code> into a <code>std::string</code>. In this case we use <code>std::cin</code> as the input stream (it is a specialization of a std::istream and can thus be used as the input). Thus we read <code>a line</code> of input from the user.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>There are a lot of other concepts encapsulated above that I don&rsquo;t want to get into quite yet. But don&rsquo;t worry I will cover them all.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We (<a href="http://SEOmoz.org">SEOmoz.org</a>) have been doing a lot of interviews for new engineers lately. I have been asked to help out trying to find the great new team members from the hordes of applicants (luckily we have a great team pre-screening applicants before they get to engineers (thanks you guys).</p>

<p>One of the things the most non-programmers are surprised about is the severity of programming interviews.</p>

<p>An on-site interview (after you have passed all the phone screens) consists of seeing between six and eight people (depending on company); this is going to take a full day and you will be utterly exhausted by the end.<br/>
But why are &ldquo;Software Engineer&rdquo; interviews so exhaustive? <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/47778/why-are-sw-engineering-interviews-disproportionately-difficult-vs-research-inte/47784#47784">I think this sums it up</a></p>

<h3>What types of interview do I do?</h3>

<p>My field of expertise is technical (not the &ldquo;<a href="http://blog.sironaconsulting.com/sironasays/2011/03/is-your-hr-manager-more-miss-marple-or-hr-20-fun-infographic.html">touchy feely</a>&rdquo; HR stuff or <a href="http://imgur.com/gallery/4D6wd">&ldquo;can you work as a team&rdquo;</a> management stuff). As a result I basically stick to one type of interview with two sub variations:</p>

<ul>
<li>Can you think on your feet</li>
<li>Do you know the basics (algorithms/data structures/Big O/CS theory)</li>
<li>Design an interacting systems at a high level thinking about the interaction</li>
</ul>


<p>I have not done phone screens in a while (this is a different skill set). I have no problem with doing them I just think other people are better than me at this kind of interview. Personally I think it is really hard to get technical information over the phone (even if you use one of those collaborative online writing tools) I would rather render my <del>judgement</del> opinion on the candidate based on talking to them face to face.</p>

<h3>So how do you get good information from a candidate?</h3>

<p>Heck if I know. During the interview it is a lot of gut feeling and pressing the candidate to expresses themselves and provide feedback on what they are thinking. <strong>Please</strong>; <span style="color: #993366;"><em>if you are a candidate explain what you are doing</em></span>, I want to know how you got the solution more than I want to know the solution you provided.</p>

<p> When asking a candidate about the basics, their inability to answer the question does not really tell me much (you may just not have used that technique in a while or missed that one class at college) so don&rsquo;t worry too much I will find something you can answer; but note, your ability to answer the question only tells me a little more (not much).</p>

<p>So when you do answer I want to know <strong>why</strong> you are using a particular technique, are there <strong>any other techniques</strong> and if so <strong>why</strong> use your initial choice over another (&lsquo;it would take too much wide board space&rsquo; is a great answer as it means you understand the alternative is very complex (but now I am going to ask you to do it :&ndash;) ))</p>

<p>Unless the company is looking for a skill in a particular language then generally my interview question are language agnostic and I will let the candidate use the language that they are most comfortable with on a white board. Though the language is not important to me, <strong><em style="text-align: justify;">the usage of the language is important</em></strong> (you better not leak memory in C/C++, you better not build strings with java.lang.string in Java, you better know how to use regular expression matching in Perl, you should understand how to use the fundamental list/dictionary types in python etc.) and most importantly <strong>you better be able to use fluently any language you list on your resume</strong> (if you are just learning/fiddling with a language make that clear).</p>

<p>Notice I have not said anything about syntax. Personally I think this is irrelevant in an interview situation. I mean I get code wrong all the time when I write it (that&rsquo;s why I have the compiler as my first line of defense and unit tests as the second). As long as I can see what you are logically trying to achieve I will not complain about missing semi-colon.</p>

<h3>The does and do not&rsquo;s for a candidate</h3>

<p>This article has a <a href="http://jobs.aol.com/articles/2011/09/12/tips-for-interviews-interviewing-etiquette-infographic/">basic guide on general etiquette</a> for interviews. While this one has some more specific guidance on what to expect at <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/80065/preparing-for-interviews/80073#80073">programming interview</a>.</p>

<p>Both mention to study the company; when I was younger I always though this was silly (I was naive once a long time ago) as I did not think it would help me do my job, but I accepted the advice of my elders and did study the companies before interviews and I must say it always paid off (but never in ways you expect).</p>

<p>Remember that I only have an hour to try and extract as much information as I can from you so don&rsquo;t go off on wild tangents stick to the point and answer the question I ask. If you can show off quickly then do so but make it quick. You should also note that interviewers generally have their questions arranged in themes, if you can answer the questions quickly he is going to move onto the next part of the same question which extends the question making it harder trying to draw more knowledge from you (can you make that more efficient/ can you see the common pit falls how do you avoid them etc).</p>

<p>On the same line don&rsquo;t give the most optimal solution first (unless that is obviously what the interviewer is looking for and you can justify it), a good interviewer is going to walk you up to the optimal solution and see if you know why its the optimal solution (But its also part of the communication I mentioned above, if you explain what you are doing (I will start with a brute force solution) even a bad interviewer should know you have an alternative optimizes solution).</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t gloss over the complex bit (unless the interviewer tells you too), this is probably the bit they want you to explain, whatever you don&rsquo;t try BS your answer. The interviewer has probably asked the question a hundred times before he has heard all the good/standard ways of solving the problem (and some more exotic ways), if you don&rsquo;t know just let the interviewer know.</p>

<h3>The don&#8217;ts for a interviewer</h3>

<p>I hate interviewers that ask those silly logic problems. They do not tell you anything about a candidates ability to write code or think critically about coding. All it tells you is that they are good a logic problems.</p>

<ul>
<li>Why is a man hole cover round?</li>
<li>If a man rows a boat at 4 mph downstream on a river traveling 2 mph. He drops his hat overboard but does not notice for an hour. How long does he need to row upstream to meet his hat?</li>
<li>Russian roulette: I have a six shooter with 2 bullets in consecutive location. I spin the chamber then shoot myself first (it does not go off). I pass the gun to you. Do you spin the chamber before shooting or not?</li>
<li>You have 1000 bottles of champagne. One bottle is contaminated and drinking from it will cause vomiting in an hour. You have an hour and ten staff to help you. What is the fewest bottles you need to discard to guarantee none of your guests gets poisoned?</li>
<li>Many more.</li>
</ul>


<p>Personally I like the problems and do well at interviews that ask them. But I don&rsquo;t think it tells you anything about me as a software engineer. As a result I don&rsquo;t ask these types of question.</p>

<p>Other people argue that it shows people that can think critically about problems. Sorry I disagree. It tends to find people that have heard the problem before and these problems turn up on websites all the time.</p>

<h3>The coding interview</h3>

<p>I previously did a second type. Sit the interviewee in front of a laptop and ask them to write code to solve a particular problem. This would involve: user input (from keyboard or file (as user input was involved I would look for error checking, but since a file was involved no error recovery)). I would provide documentation to an existing library to see if they could read and understand it enough to use it. <em>But this is blog entry for another time. But if you have some hints and comments about please post a comment below</em>.</p>
