##Functions

###Usage
All C++ applications must have at least one function; this is called `main()`. Additionally, you can have user defined functions that encapsulate individual tasks, thus allowing the code to be cleaner and easier to read. Therefore, this is a useful feature if you repeat the same task many time with only slight variations:

``` cpp function1.cpp
    #include <string>
    #include <iostream>

    int main(int argc, char* argv[])
    {
         std::cout << "What is your first name?\n";
         std::string firstName;
         std::cin >> firstName;

         std::cout << "What is your second name?\n";
         std::string secondName;
         std::cin >> secondName;

         std::cout << "What is your Mother's name?\n";
         std::string motherName;
         std::cin >> motherName;

         std::cout << "What is your Father's name?\n";
         std::string fatherName;
         std::cin >> fatherName;
    }
```

It is easy to spot the obvious repetition here. We can simplify this code by using a function that does all the common work. Anything that is unique we can pass as parameters to the function.

``` cpp function2.cpp
    #include <string>
    #include <iostream>

    std::string getNameFor(std::string who)
    {
        std::cout << "What is your " << who << " name?\n";
        std::string result;
        std::cin >> result;
        return result;
    }

    int main(int argc, char* argv[])
    {
         std::string firstName  = getNameFor("first");
         std::string secondName = getNameFor("second");
         std::string motherName = getNameFor("Mother's");
         std::string fatherName = getNameFor("Father's");
    }
```

###Definition
OK. We have seen an example but what is the exact format of a function

``` cpp function3.cpp
    // A function definition is very simple
    <ReturnType>  <FunctionName>(<OptionalArgumentList>)
    {
        <OptionalCode>
    }

    //  ReturnType:            This is the name of any type (built in or user defined)
    //                         At the end of function you must have a statement
    //                         that returns an object of this type.
    //  
    //  FunctionName:          A unique name that identifies the function.
    //
    //  OptionalArgumentList:  This is either empty.
    //                         Or a comma separated list of parameters.
    //                         Because C++ is strongly typed each parameter is defined
    //                         with both a type and a name.
    //
    //  OptionalCode:          We will be discussing this in more detail throught
    //                         these articles. But the new statement to learn is
    //                         `return <Value>`. This is the value returned by the
    //                         function to the original caller.
    //
    //  Value:                 Notice that above I use the term `Value` and not object.
    //                         A `Value` here can be an explicit object or the result
    //                         of evaluating an expression (temporary object). Note
    //                         one type of expression is a function call.
    //
    //                         return "An explicit String Object";
    //
    //                         return theResultOfAFunctionCall("Get A Result");
```    

If a function has `void` return type then you don't need to **Return Statement**. With any other return type your function must exit by using a **Return Statement**. The **Return Statement** determines the value returned to the caller from the function. The one exception to this rule (and their has to be an exception to make it a rule) is `int main()`. If you don't explicitly have a **Return Statement** int `int main()` the compiler will plant `return 0;` for you.


###Forward Declaration

One thing to note about a function is that you can not use it before a declaration. We rewrite the original example above as:

``` cpp function4.cpp
    #include <string>
    #include <iostream>

    int main(int argc, char* argv[])
    {
         std::string firstName  = getNameFor("first");
         std::string secondName = getNameFor("second");
         std::string motherName = getNameFor("Mother's");
         std::string fatherName = getNameFor("Father's");
    }

    std::string getNameFor(std::string who)
    {
        std::cout << "What is your " << who << " name?\n";
        std::string result;
        std::cin >> result;
        return result;
    }
```

The only difference from above here is that I have moved the `main()` function before the `getNameFor()` function. This will generate a compilation error as you are using the function `getNameFor()` before a declaration. This may seem a potential problem but it is a deliberate technique that makes sure you spell things correctly before use. In the above situation the only change you need to make is a forward declaration. This allows you to declare a function before you define it. The utility of this will become clear when we start defining modules.

``` cpp function5.cpp
    #include <string>
    #include <iostream>

    // Add a forward declaration
    extern std::string getNameFor(std::string who);

    // A forward declaration is basically a function declaration without a body.
    // Add an extern prefix and a semicolon on the end (the rest you should copy
    // and paste from the function definition).
    //
    //
    // Note: For the languages lawyers who want to complain about the extern.
    //       Just hold your horses we will get to the intricacies in due course;
    //       this is only lesson 4.

    int main(int argc, char* argv[])
    {
         std::string firstName  = getNameFor("first");
         std::string secondName = getNameFor("second");
         std::string motherName = getNameFor("Mother's");
         std::string fatherName = getNameFor("Father's");
    }

    std::string getNameFor(std::string who)
    {
        std::cout << "What is your " << who << " name?\n";
        std::string result;
        std::cin >> result;
        return result;
    }
```
