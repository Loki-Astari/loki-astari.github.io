##New Year/New Resolution
They say you can only get better at something by doing it.

I want to get better at writing articles about what I do so I better keep trying. Reading the articles I wrote last year (with the hindsight of a year) it seems my pros are a bit dry and laborious. So I am going to try again with an eye on fixing this problem.

My two main inspirations are colleges who do this rather well. [Kate Mate](http://katemats.com/) a highly talented manager who's opinions I respect and [Rand Fiskin](http://moz.com/rand/) the Wizard of Moz (though I am not sure he uses this tittle anymore). Both are highly respected in their fields and have the ability to write comprehensively and interestingly about subjects.
