In this article I want to put some detail around the copy assignment operator and resizing the underlying `Vector`.

In the previous article I went over basic allocation for a `Vector` like class. In this article I want to put some detail around the copy assignment operator and resizing the underlying `Vector`. Unlike the other methods previously discussed these methods have to deal with both construction and destruction of elements and the potential of exceptions interrupting the processes. The goal is to provide exception safe methods that provide the strong exception guarantee for the object and do not leak resources.

# Copy Assignment
## First Try
This is a very common first attempt at a copy constructor.
It simply calls the destructor on all elements currently in the object. Then uses the existing `push_back()` method to copy member elements from the source object, thus allowing the object to automatically resize if required.

```cpp Copy Assignment (Try 1)
class Vector
{
    std::size_t     capacity;
    std::size_t     length;
    T*              buffer;
    // STUFF
    Vector& operator=(Vector const& copy)
    {
        if (&copy == this)
        {
            // Early exit for self assignment
            return *this;
        }
        // First we have to destroy all the current elements.
        for(int loop = 0; loop < length; ++loop)
        {
            // Destroy in reverse order
            buffer[length - 1 - loop].~T();
        }
        // Now the buffer is empty so reset size to zero.
        length = 0;

        // Now copy all the elements from the source into this object
        for(int loop = 0; loop < copy.length; ++loop)
        {
            push_back(copy.buffer[loop]);
        }
        return *this;
    }
};
```

## Strong Exception Guarantee
The obvious problems about efficiency when a resize is required is a minor issue here. The real problem is that this does not provide the strong exception guarantee. If any of the constructors/destructor throw then the object will be left in an inconsistent state with no way to restore the original state. The strong exception guarantee basically means that the operation works or does not change the state of the object. The easiest technique to achieve this is to create a copy in a new temporary buffer that can be thrown away if things go wrong (leaving the current object untouched). If the copy succeeds then we use it and throw away the original data.

```cpp Copy Assignment (Try 2)
class Vector
{
    std::size_t     capacity;
    std::size_t     length;
    T*              buffer;
    // STUFF
    Vector& operator=(Vector const& copy)
    {
        if (&copy == this)
        {
            // Early exit for self assignment
            return *this;
        }
        // Part-1 Create a copy of the src object.
        std::size_t tmpCap    = copy.length;
        std::size_t tmpSize   = 0;
        T*          tmpBuffer = static_cast<T*>(::operator new(sizeof(T) * tmpCap));

        // Now copy all the elements from the source into the temporary object
        for(int loop = 0; loop < copy.length; ++loop)
        {
            new (tmpBuffer + tmpSize) T(copy.buffer[loop]);
            ++tmpSize;
        }

        // Part-2 Swap the state
        // We have successfully created the new version of this object
        // So swap the temporary and object states.
        std::swap(tmpCap,    capacity);
        std::swap(tmpSize,   length);
        std::swap(tmpBuffer, buffer);

        // Part-3 Destroy the old state.
        // Now we have to delete the old state.
        // If this fails it does not matter the state of the object is consistent
        for(int loop = 0; loop < tmpSize; ++loop)
        {
            tmpBuffer[tmpSize - 1 - loop].~T();
        }
        ::operator delete(tmpBuffer);
        return *this;
    }
};
```

## Copy and Swap
This second attempt is a better attempt. But it still leaks if an exception is throw. But before we add exception handling, let us take a closer look at the three sections of the assignment operator.

Part-1 looks exactly like the copy constructor of Vector.

```cpp Copy Assignment Part 1
        std::size_t tmpCap    = copy.length;
        std::size_t tmpSize   = 0;
        T*          tmpBuffer = static_cast<T*>(::operator new(sizeof(T) * tmpCap));

        // Now copy all the elements from the source into the temporary object
        for(int loop = 0; loop < copy.length; ++loop)
        {
            // This looks exactly like push_back()
            new (tmpBuffer + tmpSize) T(copy.buffer[loop]);
            ++tmpSize;
        }
```

Part-3 looks exactly like destructor of Vector.
```cpp Copy Assignment Part 3
        // Now we have to delete the old state.
        for(int loop = 0; loop < tmpSize; ++loop)
        {
            tmpBuffer[tmpSize - 1 - loop].~T();
        }
        ::operator delete(tmpBuffer);
```

Using these two observations we have a rewrite of the copy assignment operator.

```cpp Copy Assignment (Try 3)
class Vector
{
    std::size_t     capacity;
    std::size_t     length;
    T*              buffer;
    // STUFF
    Vector& operator=(Vector const& copy)
    {
        if (&copy == this)
        {
            // Early exit for self assignment
            return *this;
        }
        // Part-1 Create a copy
        Vector  tmp(copy);

        // Part-2 Swap the state
        std::swap(tmp.capacity, capacity);
        std::swap(tmp.length,   length);
        std::swap(tmp.buffer,   buffer);

        return *this;
        // Part-3 Destructor called at end of scope.
        // No actual code required here.
    }
};
```
## [Copy And Swap Idiom](http://stackoverflow.com/q/3279543/14065)

The copy and swap idiom is about dealing with replacing an object state from another object. It is very commonly used in the copy assignment operator but has application whenever state is being changed and the [strong exception guarantee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exception_safety) is required.

The above code works perfectly. But in Part-2 the swap looks like a normal swap operation so let's use that rather than doing it manually. Also self assignment now works without the need for a test (because we are copying into a temporary). So we can remove the check for self assignment. Yes this does make the performance for self assignment worse, but it makes the normal operation even more efficient. Since the occurrence of self assignment is extremely rare I would not prematurely optimize for it but rather make the most common case the best optimized. So one final refactor of the copy constructor leaves us with this.

```cpp Copy Assignment (Try 4)
class Vector
{
    std::size_t     capacity;
    std::size_t     length;
    T*              buffer;
    // STUFF
    Vector& operator=(Vector const& copy)
    {
        Vector  tmp(copy);
        tmp.swap(*this);
        return *this;
    }
    void swap(Vector& other) noexcept
    {
        std::swap(other.capacity, capacity);
        std::swap(other.length,   length);
        std::swap(other.buffer,   buffer);
    }
};
```

# Resizing Underling buffer

When pushing data into the array we need to verify that capacity has not been exceeded. If it has then we need to allocate more capacity then copy the current content into the new buffer and destroy the old buffer after calling the destructor on all elements.

## Using Copy and Swap
This operation is exceedingly similar to the description of the copy assignment operator. As a result the best solution looks very similar and uses the Copy and Swap idiom.

```cpp Vector Reallocating Buffer
class Vector
{
    std::size_t     capacity;
    std::size_t     length;
    T*              buffer;
    // STUFF
    void resizeIfRequire()
    {
        if (length == capacity)
        {
            // Create a temporary object with a larger capacity.
            std::size_t     newCapacity  = std::max(2.0, capacity * 1.62);
            Vector<T>  tmpBuffer(newCapacity);

            // Copy the state of this object into the new object.
            std::for_each(buffer, buffer + length, [&tmpBuffer](T const& item){tmpBuffer.push_back(item);});

            // All the work has been successfully done. So swap
            // the state of the temporary and the current object.
            tmpBuffer.swap(*this);

            // The temporary object goes out of scope here and
            // tidies up the state that is no longer needed.
        }
    }
};
```
