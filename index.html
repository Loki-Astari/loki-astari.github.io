<p>Writing you own implementation of a smart pointer is a bad idea (IMO). The standardization and testing of smart pointers was a nine year process through <a href="http://www.boost.org/">boost</a>, with <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_57_0/libs/smart_ptr/shared_ptr.htm">boost::shared_ptr</a> and <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_57_0/libs/smart_ptr/scoped_ptr.htm">boost::scoped_ptr</a>, finally resulting in the standardized versions being released in C++11: <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/shared_ptr">std::shared_ptr</a> and <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/unique_ptr">std::unique_ptr</a>.</p>

<p>I would even say that I dislike the smart pointer as a learning device; it seems like a very simple project for a newbie, but in reality (as indicated by the nine year standardization processes) to get it working correctly in all contexts is rather a complex indevour.</p>

<p>But because it is such a frequent request for review; I want take a look at smart pointers as a teaching exercise. In the next couple of articles I will step through the processes of building a smart pointer and look at some of the common mistakes that I see (and probably make a few as I go).</p>

<h2>First Bash</h2>

<p>So lets get started. The two most common smart pointers are <code>unique</code> and <code>shared</code>. So lets start with the one that seems the simplest (<code>unique</code>)and see where we go.</p>

<p>It would seem that we could bash out a quick unique pointer like this:</p>

<pre><code>namespace ThorsAnvil
{
    template&lt;typename T&gt;
    class UP
    {
        T*   data;
        public:
            UP(T* data)
                : data(data)
            {}
            ~UP()
            {
                delete data;
            }
            T* operator-&gt;() {return data;}
            T&amp; operator*()  {return *data;}
            T* release()
            {
                T* result = nullptr;
                std::swap(result, data);
                return result;
            }
    };
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Problem 1: Rule of Three Violation</h3>

<p>The first problem here is that we are not obeying the &ldquo;<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/4172722/14065">rule of three</a>&rdquo;. Since we have a destructor that does memory management we should also handle the copy constructor and assignment operator. Otherwise the following is allowed and will cause undefined behavior:</p>

<pre><code>int test1()
{
    ThorsAnvil::SP   sp1&lt;int&gt;(new int(5));
    ThorsAnvil::SP   sp2&lt;int&gt;(sp1);  // copy construction

             // Here the compiler generated copy constructor
             // kicks in and does a member wise copy of sp1
             // into sp2. That in itself is not a problem.
 }
 // But when sp2 goes out of scope its destructor kicks in
 // and deletes the pointer. When sp1 subsequently follows
 // sp2 out of scope it will also call delete on the same
 // pointer (as they share a copy of the pointer).
 // 
 // This is known as a double delete and causes
 // undefined behavior (UB).
</code></pre>

<p> The assignment operator is slightly worse:</p>

<pre><code>int test2()
{
    ThorsAnvil::SP   sp1&lt;int&gt;(new int(5));
    ThorsAnvil::SP   sp2&lt;int&gt;(new int(6));

    sp2 = sp1; // Assignment operation.

             // Here the compiler generated assignment 
             // operator kicks in and does a member wise 
             // assignment of sp1 into sp2.
             //
             // The main problem with the assignment here
             // is that we have lost the original pointer
             // that sp2 was holding.
 }
 // Same issues with double delete as the copy constructor.
</code></pre>

<p>This is caused by the compiler atomically generating default implementations of certain methods (see discussion on the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/4172722/14065">rule of three</a>) if the user does not explicitly specify otherwise. I have heard this described as a language bug; but I have to disagree with that sentiment, as these compiler generated methods do exactly as you would expect in nearly all situations. The one exceptions is when the class contains &ldquo;owned raw pointers&rdquo;.</p>

<h3>Problem 2: Implicit construction.</h3>

<p>The next issue is caused by C++ tendency to eagerly convert one type to another if given half a chance. If your class contains a constructor that takes a single argument then the compiler will use this as a way of converting one type to another.</p>

<p><strong><em>Example</em></strong>:</p>

<pre><code>void takeOwner1(ThorsAnvil::UP&lt;int&gt; x)
{}
void takeOwner2(ThorsAnvil::UP&lt;int&gt; const&amp; x)
{}
void takeOwner3(ThorsAnvil::UP&lt;int&gt;&amp;&amp; x)
{}
int main()
{
    int*   data = new int(7);

    takeOwner1(data);
    takeOwner2(data);
    takeOwner3(data);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Though none of the functions in the example take an <code>int pointer</code> as a parameter; the compiler sees that it can convert an <code>int*</code> into an object of type <code>ThorsAnvil::UP&lt;int&gt;</code> via the single argument constructor and builds temporary objects to facilitate the calling of the function.</p>

<p>In the case of smart pointers, that take ownership of the object passed in the constructor, this can be a problem because the lifetime of a temporary object is the containing statement (with a few exceptions that we will cover in another article). As a simple rule of thumb you can think of the lifespan of a temporary ending at the <code>';'</code>.</p>

<pre><code>takeOwner1(data);

// You can think of this as functionally equivalent to:

{
    ThorsAnvil::UP&lt;int&gt; tmp(data);
    takeOwner1(tmp);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem here is that when <code>tmp</code> goes out of scope its destructor will call delete on the pointer. Thus <code>data</code> is now pointing at memory that has been destroyed (and thus no longer belongs to the application). Any further use of <code>data</code> is going to potentially cause problems (and I am being generous using the word potentially).</p>

<p>This feature can be quite useful (when you want this conversion to happen easily, see std::string). But you should definitely be aware of it and think carefully about creating single argument constructors.</p>

<h3>Problem 3: Null de-referencing</h3>

<p>I think it is obvious that <code>operator*</code> has an issue with dereferencing a Null pointer here:</p>

<pre><code>            T&amp; operator*()  {return *data;}
</code></pre>

<p>But it is not quite as obvious that <code>operator-&gt;</code> is also going to cause dereferencing of the pointer here:</p>

<pre><code>            T* operator-&gt;() {return data;}
</code></pre>

<p>There are a couple of solutions to this problem. You can check <code>data</code> and throw an exception if it is a Null pointer, or alternatively you can make it a pre-condition on the usage of the smart pointer (ie it is the responsibility of the user to either know or check before using methods).</p>

<p>The standard has chosen to go with a pre-condition (a very common C++ practice: do not impose an overhead on all your users (to spare problems for the beginner), but rather provide a mechanism for those that need; so they can choose to pay the overhead when they need to and not every time). We can do the same here but we have not provided any mechanism for the user to check the state of the smart pointer.</p>

<h3>Problem 4: Const Correctness</h3>

<p>When accessing the owned object via a smart pointer we are not affecting the state of our smart pointer so any member that basically returns the object (without changing the state of the smart pointer) should be marked cost.</p>

<pre><code>            T* operator-&gt;() {return data;}
            T&amp; operator*()  {return *data;}
</code></pre>

<p>So these two methods should really be declared as:</p>

<pre><code>            T* operator-&gt;() const {return data;}
            T&amp; operator*()  const {return *data;}
</code></pre>

<h2>Fixed First Try</h2>

<p>So given the problems described above we can update our implementation to compensate for these issues:</p>

<pre><code>namespace ThorsAnvil
{
    template&lt;typename T&gt;
    class UP
    {
        T*   data;
        public:
            // Explicit constructor
            explicit UP(T* data)
                : data(data)
            {}
            ~UP()
            {
                delete data;
            }
            // Remove compiler generated methods.
            UP(UP const&amp;)           = delete;
            UP&amp; operator=(UP const&amp;) = delete;

            // Const correct access owned object
            T* operator-&gt;() const {return data;}
            T&amp; operator*()  const {return *data;}

            // Access to smart pointer state
            T* get()        const {return data;}
            operator bool() const {return data;}

            // Modify object state
            T* release()
            {
                T* result = nullptr;
                std::swap(result, data);
                return result;
            }
    };
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you are thinking this is not enough you are correct. We still have some more work to do. But lets leave it at that for version one.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>So in this initial post we have looked at a typical first attempt at a smart pointer and summarized the common problems I often see in these home grown smart pointer implementations. We need to dig a bit deeper before we are finished though.</p>

<p>They say you can only get better at something by doing it.</p>

<p>I want to get better at writing articles about what I do so I better keep trying. Reading the articles I wrote last year (with the hindsight of a year) it seems my pros are a bit dry and laborious. So I am going to try again with an eye on fixing this problem.</p>

<p>My two main inspirations are colleges who do this rather well. <a href="http://katemats.com/">Kate Mate</a> a highly talented manager who&rsquo;s opinions I respect and <a href="http://moz.com/rand/">Rand Fiskin</a> the Wizard of Moz (though I am not sure he uses this tittle anymore). Both are highly respected in their fields and have the ability to write comprehensively and interestingly about subjects.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Control Flow</h2>

<p>So far we have demonstrated basic programs that just do a single task without making any decisions. Most (all but the most trivial) programming languages provide constructs for decision making (Conditional Branching).</p>

<p>C++ provides two forms of branching. The <strong>&ldquo;If Statement&rdquo;</strong> and the <strong>&ldquo;Switch Statement&rdquo;</strong> .</p>

<p>Note: Looping is also a form of branching. The looping concept is extensive enough that we will deal with looping separately in its own article.</p>

<h3>If Statement</h3>

<p>The <strong>&ldquo;If Statement&rdquo;</strong> allows code to be executed when a certain condition is fulfilled and optionally an alternative piece of code otherwise.</p>

<p>The standard comparison operators that you find in most languages can be used. These operators are defined for all the built-in types. On user defined types in the standard library they are defined in ways that makes their usage obvious. When you define these for your user defined types you should also make sure that they behave in the logical manner described below; the language does not enforce this, <strong>BUT</strong> if you don&rsquo;t follow this suggestion your types will scare people and they will not be used, so follow the expected behavior.</p>

<h3>Switch Statement</h3>

<p>The <strong>&ldquo;Switch Statement&rdquo;</strong> is an alternative to the <strong>&ldquo;If Statement&rdquo;</strong>. Prefer the switch when you have lots of options derived from the same expression. Unlike other high level language C++ can only use <strong>Integer</strong> types in a switch statement; thus in all `Case &lt;Value&gt; the &lt;Value&gt; must be an integer <strong>literal</strong> value.</p>

<p>Note I: The language does not require you to use a <strong>Break Statement</strong> in each block. <strong>BUT</strong> you should and compilers will warn you when you don&rsquo;t.<br/>
Note II: You should always use a <strong>Default Statement</strong> . If the value does not hit a value specified in a <strong>Case Statement</strong> then the <strong>Default Statement</strong> is used; If the <strong>Default Statement</strong> is not defined in this situation it results in undefined behavior. To avoid problems you should always define the <strong>Default Statement</strong>, even if all this does is generate an error. This will avoid maintenance issues down the road.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Switching to OctoPress and Github</h2>

<p>I have not blogged much, until recently, so I am not an HTML/CSS/Javascript expert. Thus layout, or layout during writing an article, is not of supreme importance for me. I expect the framework to handle that all for me. But that was my issue with WordPress. As a normal blogger I am sure it is not an issue, but the tools for blogging about code are rudimentary and not well integrated in to WordPress; basically forcing me to write in HTML (see <a href="http://lokiastari.com/blog/2013/11/12/want-to-set-up-wordpress-to-write-about-programming/">Set up WordPress</a>). I do write a lot on other sites that specialize in coding and these sites have developed a style called &lt;MarkDown&gt;. The two most common versions are &lsquo;<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/editing-help">StackOverFlow markdown</a>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">GitHub markdown</a>&rsquo;.</p>

<h3>MarkDown</h3>

<p>Markdown is a very simplistic form of &lsquo;Markup&rsquo; (yes programmers think they are funny with the up/down thing) that is designed specifically to be simple and deal with the common issues of writing word based articles. Coder sites usually extend this with basic support for placing code (or preformatted text) directly into the article. It is not designed for non technical people (they should be using a &lsquo;Visual&rsquo; interface not markup) but for the technical writer who does not want the full blown power of HTML, but wants slightly more control than visual interfaces provide.</p>

<h3>Attack Vector</h3>

<p>WordPress is also infamous for being the target of attackers, thus new attacks are constantly being developed (the joy of being top dog). This can be mitigated by putting your WordPress site on <a href="wordpress.com">wordpress.com</a>. This not only provides you with free hosting, but they do keep on top of security vulnerabilities and make sure all hosted sites are not overexposed.</p>

<p>If you want use your own domain name (i.e. <a href="LokiAstari.com">LokiAstari.com</a>) or any other &ldquo;featured&rdquo; services then you either need to fork up the cash (not an insignificant sum) or run your own WordPress site. So I have been running my own WordPress sites. However, running your own site opens you to the vulnerabilities of WordPress attacks. To be honest not a big deal until I actually tweeted about my articles (now very much so).</p>

<p>So the combination of these two issues has made me look for alternatives.</p>

<h3>OctoPress</h3>

<p><a href="octopress.org">OctoPress</a> was suggested by a colleague <a href="https://github.com/danlecocq">Dan Lecocq</a>. It is basically an off-line blogging system that takes your articles and creates a set of static pages. You can then use several systems to publish these static pages. As the pages are generated once (each time you create a new article) the requirements for the hosting system are minimal, and consequently, because there is no dynamic content, there are no attack vectors that can be used against the site. Note: This does not mean the site has to be simple or boring as the pages can still have dynamic content loaded from other sites (like twitter/github/facebook etc.) It is just that the dynamic content will be fetched by the browser from other sites.</p>

<p>The other major advantage is that it natively supports MarkDown. In fact, you plug in your favorite MarkDown engine (I have currently stuck with the default &lsquo;GitHub markdown&rsquo;). So you can write your article in MarkDown, and it will translate to the appropriate HTML.</p>

<p>Like WordPress it has multiple themes, unlike WordPress the user base is small so the pool of user created themes is tiny in comparison (a couple of dozen). Though not as well established as WordPress, you can easily extend it and build your own themes. There are already a couple of themes based on <a href="https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap">Bootstrap</a> the most commonly forked HTML5/CSS/Javascript web-site project on <a href="github.com">GitHub</a>.</p>

<h3>GitHub</h3>

<p>OctoPress also integrates with <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> a feature of the site designed to allow you to create documentation for your software.</p>

<p>Though this is still not my perfect writing environment; OctoPress is a step up from using WordPress (for me, if you are not used to writing code it will not be good for you and I would stick to WordPress&rsquo;s Visual editor). There are a couple of tweaks I still need to iron out here and there. Once I have got a basic system working perfectly I will talk about exactly what I did. I have some ideas on how to improve the basics which may be down the road a bit (I need to perform more research how others are using this tool so I don&rsquo;t reinvent the wheel).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Functions</h2>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>All C++ applications must have at least one function; this is called <code>main()</code>. Additionally, you can have user defined functions that encapsulate individual tasks, thus allowing the code to be cleaner and easier to read. Therefore, this is a useful feature if you repeat the same task many time with only slight variations:</p>

<p>It is easy to spot the obvious repetition here. We can simplify this code by using a function that does all the common work. Anything that is unique we can pass as parameters to the function.</p>

<p></p>

<p>If a function has <code>void</code> return type then you don&rsquo;t need to <strong>Return Statement</strong>. With any other return type your function must exit by using a <strong>Return Statement</strong>. The <strong>Return Statement</strong> determines the value returned to the caller from the function. The one exception to this rule (and their has to be an exception to make it a rule) is <code>int main()</code>. If you don&rsquo;t explicitly have a <strong>Return Statement</strong> int <code>int main()</code> the compiler will plant <code>return 0;</code> for you.</p>

<h3>Forward Declaration</h3>

<p>One thing to note about a function is that you can not use it before a declaration. We rewrite the original example above as:</p>

<p>The only difference from above here is that I have moved the <code>main()</code> function before the <code>getNameFor()</code> function. This will generate a compilation error as you are using the function <code>getNameFor()</code> before a declaration. This may seem a potential problem but it is a deliberate technique that makes sure you spell things correctly before use. In the above situation the only change you need to make is a forward declaration. This allows you to declare a function before you define it. The utility of this will become clear when we start defining modules.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Variables</h2>

<p>In most programming languages you have the concept of variables. These are simply named objects that hold a value (more formerly refereed to as state). By manipulating a variable you manipulate the state of the object that the variable referees too.</p>

<p>C++ is a strongly typed language. This means that each variable has a specific type that does not change (above that type is <strong>int</strong>). The operations that can be performed on an object are dependent on the type of the object and the result of the operation can depend on the types involved. C++ has several built in types (listed below) but allows the definition of new user defined types (which will be described in a later article). The standard library provides a set of commonly used user defined types (listed below).</p>

<p>The list may seem a bit daunting at first, but while you are learning if you restrict yourselves to three built in types (<strong>bool</strong>, <strong>int</strong> and <strong>double</strong>) and two standard types (<strong>std::string</strong> and <strong>std::vector&lt;T&gt;</strong>) you will be able to solve most beginner/training problems.</p>

<p>The other built in types are usually used when you need larger range of values or need to save space. The additional standard type (shown above) are different types of container and provide different accesses characteristics (which will be explained later). We will cover all these types in due course.</p>

<p>So an example of usage of the most common types is:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Common Mistakes</h2>

<h3>1: using namspace</h3>

<p>Every new developer that comes to C++ always starts writing code like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>myfirstprog.cpp</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='cpp'><span class='line'><span class="cp">#include &lt;iostream&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">using</span> <span class="k">namespace</span> <span class="n">std</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>It seems reasonable and every book on learning C++ out there perpetrates the same mistake. The problem is the &ldquo; <strong>using namespace std;</strong> &rdquo;. On programs that are only 10 lines long (like in most books) it does not cause any problems. But as soon as your code strays to any meaningful size then it starts to become an issue. The problem with teaching new developers this technique is that they are not aware of the problems it causes and so it becomes a habit for all code they write. Break this habit <strong>now</strong> before you start doing it without thinking at the top of every source file you write.</p>

<p>So what are the actual issues? Please read this article: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/1452721/14065">Why is “using namespace std;” considered bad practice?</a> and the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/1453605/14065">best Answer</a> that explains what the problem is in detail.</p>

<p>We call this problem namespace pollution. What the <code>using</code> clause is doing is pulling everything from the named namespace into the current namespace; this will cause issues if there is already code in the current namespace. Doing this in your source file is bad enough but even worse is doing this in your header file. The problem with doing it in a header file is that you pollute the namespace for every source file that includes your header file. If the user of the header file is not aware of this pollution then trying to track down a suddenly new issue becomes really very hard.</p>

<p>But not doing this is causing my much more typing!</p>

</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If you think adding <code>std::</code> as a prefix to anything in the standard namespace is a bother (then you need another language); there is a solution. Only pull into the current namespace what you actually need. And then try and restrict the scope so it is tight as possible;</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>short.cpp</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">using</span> <span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">cout</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="c1">// The using clause is scoped and thus cout is only in the global namespace for</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="c1">// the scope of the main() function.</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">cout</span> <span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="s">&quot;Hello Workld</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s">&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>An additional technique to shorten namespace prefixes are namespace alias. These are very useful when things are nested inside multiple namespaces (or have very long unhelpful names)</p>

<h3>2: Prefixing identifiers with &#39;&#95;&#39;</h3>

<p>A lot of developers new to C++ try to learn by browsing the standard libraries and getting there habits from things done there or bring conventions from their current favorite languages into there C++ code. One of the things they ultimately pick up on is using &lsquo;_&rsquo; as a prefix for identifiers.</p>

<p>Though technically not wrong in all situations the actual rules on using the &lsquo;<em>&rsquo; as an identifier prefix are non trivial. Thus making it a habit will eventually get you burnt. The issue is that most identifiers that have prefix &lsquo;</em>&rsquo; are reserved for use by the implementation, thus the compiler/linker may potentially do special things with them. You can read up on the issue here: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/228783/14065">What are the rules about using an underscore in a C++ identifier?</a>.</p>

<h3>3: void main()</h3>

<p>There are only two valid declarations from main in C++</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Setting up WordPress to display syntax highlighted code was a struggle due to different plugins that don’t all seem to work together, the different types of editor, etc. I don’t want to learn all about WordPress. I just want to write some simple articles.</p>

<p>I am at the point where I am productive and don’t destroy my articles accidentally by switching between Visual editor and Text editor, however, I am still not totally happy. Writing articles in pure HTML is not the best solution. Even with help buttons, this is the realm of the web developer that needs to lay out elements perfectly. The article writer (blogger) just needs text to flow and highlight with a smattering of subtle color. I would prefer some slightly higher level markup such as in <code>Stackoverflow</code> or <code>github</code> preferably. If you have worked through this problem and have a good solution, drop me a line.</p>

<p>Here is a list of things I did to make myself productive:</p>

<ul>
<li>Turn off the Visual Editor <br/>
  Switching between the <code>visual</code> editor and the <code>text</code> editor always seems to destroy something in the code. What survived and what was mutated depended on the plugins but the result was always disastrous. Therefore turn it off. <br/>
  Of course this means I am now writing in HTML (not perfect buy I can manage). <br/>
  Goto <code>Users-&gt;Your Profile</code>. The first option allows you to disable the visual editor</li>
<li>Install the plugins:

<ul>
<li>Crayon Syntax Highlighter:  <br/>
There are a lot of syntax highlighters out there. It does not matter which one you choose as they all seem to use the same back-end to do the coloring. This one worked for me.</li>
<li>Preserve Code Formatting: <br/>
This prevents WordPress from mucking with the spaces between the &lt;pre&gt; tags.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>I also asked on <a href="http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/123040/standard-developer-markup-plugins">WordPress.stackexchange.com : Standard developer markup plugins</a> but did not get much help.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>OK. Lets do this.</p>

<p>I keep trying to think about something big and interesting to write about. But that is just not working. All my time is spent trying to think of the blockbuster idea; which just gets in the way of actually writing. So lets start with the small things. If I can get into the habit of writing something a couple of times a week. Then maybe we can work up to interesting stuff.</p>

<p>Step one; write about something I know. C++; we now start the &ldquo;So you want to learn C++&rdquo; series of posts.</p>

<p>I am going to assume two things.</p>

<ul>
<li>You know how to use the compiler</li>
<li>That you have some basic programming experience C/Java/C#/Perl/Php (nealy anything) <br/>
So you understand the basics of program but are unfamiliar with C++</li>
</ul>


<p>First thing everybody needs is to get something working; here is the classic &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; in C++</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>helloworld.cpp</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>

<p>The next step is to accepts user input and generates a response based on that input. Lets move on to the not quite as classic &ldquo;Hi There Bob&rdquo; :&ndash;)</p>

<p>The above code is relatively simple and only a few things to note:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;</code> <br/>
Imports the standard input and output facilities so you can print messages to the user and read user input.

<ul>
<li><code>std::cin</code>  <br/>
Is the standard input stream. From this you can read user input.</li>
<li><code>std::cout</code>  <br/>
Is the standard output stream. You can print text to the user console.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>#include &lt;string&gt;</code> <br/>
Imports the standard string handling function. Most importantly it imports the type <code>std::string</code>.

<ul>
<li><code>std::string</code> <br/>
This is one of the standard types and holds strings (a list of characters). We will go over types (and variables) in a lot more details in subsequent articles. But for just accept that <code>line</code> is a variable (of type std::string) used to hold a line of user input.</li>
<li><code>std::getline()</code> <br/>
This is a function that reads a line of text from a <code>std::istream</code> into a <code>std::string</code>. In this case we use <code>std::cin</code> as the input stream (it is a specialization of a std::istream and can thus be used as the input). Thus we read <code>a line</code> of input from the user.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>There are a lot of other concepts encapsulated above that I don&rsquo;t want to get into quite yet. But don&rsquo;t worry I will cover them all.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We (<a href="http://SEOmoz.org">SEOmoz.org</a>) have been doing a lot of interviews for new engineers lately. I have been asked to help out trying to find the great new team members from the hordes of applicants (luckily we have a great team pre-screening applicants before they get to engineers (thanks you guys).</p>

<p>One of the things the most non-programmers are surprised about is the severity of programming interviews.</p>

<p>An on-site interview (after you have passed all the phone screens) consists of seeing between six and eight people (depending on company); this is going to take a full day and you will be utterly exhausted by the end.<br/>
But why are &ldquo;Software Engineer&rdquo; interviews so exhaustive? <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/47778/why-are-sw-engineering-interviews-disproportionately-difficult-vs-research-inte/47784#47784">I think this sums it up</a></p>

<h3>What types of interview do I do?</h3>

<p>My field of expertise is technical (not the &ldquo;<a href="http://blog.sironaconsulting.com/sironasays/2011/03/is-your-hr-manager-more-miss-marple-or-hr-20-fun-infographic.html">touchy feely</a>&rdquo; HR stuff or <a href="http://imgur.com/gallery/4D6wd">&ldquo;can you work as a team&rdquo;</a> management stuff). As a result I basically stick to one type of interview with two sub variations:</p>

<ul>
<li>Can you think on your feet</li>
<li>Do you know the basics (algorithms/data structures/Big O/CS theory)</li>
<li>Design an interacting systems at a high level thinking about the interaction</li>
</ul>


<p>I have not done phone screens in a while (this is a different skill set). I have no problem with doing them I just think other people are better than me at this kind of interview. Personally I think it is really hard to get technical information over the phone (even if you use one of those collaborative online writing tools) I would rather render my <del>judgement</del> opinion on the candidate based on talking to them face to face.</p>

<h3>So how do you get good information from a candidate?</h3>

<p>Heck if I know. During the interview it is a lot of gut feeling and pressing the candidate to expresses themselves and provide feedback on what they are thinking. <strong>Please</strong>; <span style="color: #993366;"><em>if you are a candidate explain what you are doing</em></span>, I want to know how you got the solution more than I want to know the solution you provided.</p>

<p> When asking a candidate about the basics, their inability to answer the question does not really tell me much (you may just not have used that technique in a while or missed that one class at college) so don&rsquo;t worry too much I will find something you can answer; but note, your ability to answer the question only tells me a little more (not much).</p>

<p>So when you do answer I want to know <strong>why</strong> you are using a particular technique, are there <strong>any other techniques</strong> and if so <strong>why</strong> use your initial choice over another (&lsquo;it would take too much wide board space&rsquo; is a great answer as it means you understand the alternative is very complex (but now I am going to ask you to do it :&ndash;) ))</p>

<p>Unless the company is looking for a skill in a particular language then generally my interview question are language agnostic and I will let the candidate use the language that they are most comfortable with on a white board. Though the language is not important to me, <strong><em style="text-align: justify;">the usage of the language is important</em></strong> (you better not leak memory in C/C++, you better not build strings with java.lang.string in Java, you better know how to use regular expression matching in Perl, you should understand how to use the fundamental list/dictionary types in python etc.) and most importantly <strong>you better be able to use fluently any language you list on your resume</strong> (if you are just learning/fiddling with a language make that clear).</p>

<p>Notice I have not said anything about syntax. Personally I think this is irrelevant in an interview situation. I mean I get code wrong all the time when I write it (that&rsquo;s why I have the compiler as my first line of defense and unit tests as the second). As long as I can see what you are logically trying to achieve I will not complain about missing semi-colon.</p>

<h3>The does and do not&rsquo;s for a candidate</h3>

<p>This article has a <a href="http://jobs.aol.com/articles/2011/09/12/tips-for-interviews-interviewing-etiquette-infographic/">basic guide on general etiquette</a> for interviews. While this one has some more specific guidance on what to expect at <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/80065/preparing-for-interviews/80073#80073">programming interview</a>.</p>

<p>Both mention to study the company; when I was younger I always though this was silly (I was naive once a long time ago) as I did not think it would help me do my job, but I accepted the advice of my elders and did study the companies before interviews and I must say it always paid off (but never in ways you expect).</p>

<p>Remember that I only have an hour to try and extract as much information as I can from you so don&rsquo;t go off on wild tangents stick to the point and answer the question I ask. If you can show off quickly then do so but make it quick. You should also note that interviewers generally have their questions arranged in themes, if you can answer the questions quickly he is going to move onto the next part of the same question which extends the question making it harder trying to draw more knowledge from you (can you make that more efficient/ can you see the common pit falls how do you avoid them etc).</p>

<p>On the same line don&rsquo;t give the most optimal solution first (unless that is obviously what the interviewer is looking for and you can justify it), a good interviewer is going to walk you up to the optimal solution and see if you know why its the optimal solution (But its also part of the communication I mentioned above, if you explain what you are doing (I will start with a brute force solution) even a bad interviewer should know you have an alternative optimizes solution).</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t gloss over the complex bit (unless the interviewer tells you too), this is probably the bit they want you to explain, whatever you don&rsquo;t try BS your answer. The interviewer has probably asked the question a hundred times before he has heard all the good/standard ways of solving the problem (and some more exotic ways), if you don&rsquo;t know just let the interviewer know.</p>

<h3>The don&#8217;ts for a interviewer</h3>

<p>I hate interviewers that ask those silly logic problems. They do not tell you anything about a candidates ability to write code or think critically about coding. All it tells you is that they are good a logic problems.</p>

<ul>
<li>Why is a man hole cover round?</li>
<li>If a man rows a boat at 4 mph downstream on a river traveling 2 mph. He drops his hat overboard but does not notice for an hour. How long does he need to row upstream to meet his hat?</li>
<li>Russian roulette: I have a six shooter with 2 bullets in consecutive location. I spin the chamber then shoot myself first (it does not go off). I pass the gun to you. Do you spin the chamber before shooting or not?</li>
<li>You have 1000 bottles of champagne. One bottle is contaminated and drinking from it will cause vomiting in an hour. You have an hour and ten staff to help you. What is the fewest bottles you need to discard to guarantee none of your guests gets poisoned?</li>
<li>Many more.</li>
</ul>


<p>Personally I like the problems and do well at interviews that ask them. But I don&rsquo;t think it tells you anything about me as a software engineer. As a result I don&rsquo;t ask these types of question.</p>

<p>Other people argue that it shows people that can think critically about problems. Sorry I disagree. It tends to find people that have heard the problem before and these problems turn up on websites all the time.</p>

<h3>The coding interview</h3>

<p>I previously did a second type. Sit the interviewee in front of a laptop and ask them to write code to solve a particular problem. This would involve: user input (from keyboard or file (as user input was involved I would look for error checking, but since a file was involved no error recovery)). I would provide documentation to an existing library to see if they could read and understand it enough to use it. <em>But this is blog entry for another time. But if you have some hints and comments about please post a comment below</em>.</p>
